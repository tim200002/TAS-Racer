# What is this package about

This package is not really part of my submission. Instead here I wanted to show the differences between my first approach to the preprocessing using standard python `old_preprocessing.ipynb` and the new one `new_preprocessing.ipynb`. It might be interesting to have a look on to see why I decided to completely reimplement everything.
